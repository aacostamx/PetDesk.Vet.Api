# PetDesk.Vet.Api

Part of our interview process is a small coding project, as we believe the best way to gauge a
candidate is to see work in a real world scenario rather than a bunch of technical questions or
tests.
So for the next step, I'd like you to make a small web app using ASP.NET MVC or .NET Core.
Think of me as a customer with requirements for this project. This will allow us to have some
interaction and give both of us a better sense of working together.
Project Description
At PetDesk one thing we do is give pet owners the ability to easily request appointments (appts)
with their veterinarian (vet) through a mobile app. Currently the vet receives and responds to
these through a web application. In this project we'd like to see your take on this web
application.
https://sampledata.petdesk.com/api/appointments is a simple static API that returns JSON data
for appointments. An appointment contains the following:
● Details on the appt (type and requested date/time)
● Client data (name of person requesting the appointment)
● Patient data (name and type of pet the appt is for)
The web app should read in this appt data and display it for the vet. Then it should allow the vet
to perform two actions:
● Confirm the requested date and time
● Offer an alternative date and time
You do not need to worry about actually sending the confirmation/reschedule anywhere, nor
does any of this information need to be stored in a database. The app only needs to visually
acknowledge the action.
Other than these requirements it is entirely up to you on how to structure, design, and
implement the app solution you are providing. Don't feel that there is any absolute right or
wrong solution, and feel free to use any available online resources as you see fit.
Also, feel free to ask me any questions you have or discuss any of the requirements. As the
customer I will provide answers and clarifications you request, and if we need to set up a call to
discuss that can be arranged.
Requirements
● Project must be written in C#
● Deliverable project must be able to be compiled and run locally as a web application
(submit any instructions as needed)
● Afterwards we will schedule a follow up for you to present your solution and field
questions
What we are looking for
● How you approach the overall task
● Thought process on design and decisions
● Thought process on user experience
● Communication during the process
● Overall implementation of the solution
Before starting please give me your best estimate for how long this would take you to
complete. This is not intended to be a large task, so if there are parts that you think too
complex or lengthy, let me know, and we can adjust the requirements
